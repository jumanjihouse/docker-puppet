### Diff churn

Please minimize diff churn to enhance git history commands.

* Arrays should usually be multi-line with trailing commas.

* Use 2-space soft tabs and trim trailing whitespace.<br/>
  http://editorconfig.org provides editor plugins to handle this
  for you automatically based on the `.editorconfig` in this repo.


### Linear history

Use `git rebase upstream/master` to update your branch.
The primary reason for this is to maintain a clean, linear history
via "fast-forward" merges to master.
A clean, linear history in master makes it easier
to troubleshoot regressions and follow the timeline.
